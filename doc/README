RUNNING

    The tool can be run from the command line as an executable jar file, as:

        java -jar relaxws.jar -d output-dir <intput-file>

    I believe the output-dir is required, so for current dir put "." if getting an exception.

BUILDING

    Requires ant 1.7, jdk 1.5, and groovy 1.5.1 to build.  See build.xml for instructions.
